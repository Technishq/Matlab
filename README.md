# Welcome Welcome!

## Notes:
- **Remember kids:** Error in FSK is the least, QPSK has the highest error. Keep your bits straight, and your errors crooked!

## Description:
Welcome to the repository of laughable MATLAB code for your labs! Here, we've managed to turn the mundane world of lab assignments into a comedy show. Brace yourself for code that not only runs your simulations but also tickles your funny bone.

## Contents:
- **Lab1:** _"Generation of Rayleigh and Rician Fading Channels using MATLAB"_
  - *Description:* Watch as Rayleigh and Rician Fading Channels appear and disappear like mischievous ghosts!
  - *Highlights:* Experience the drama of fading channels, where signals vanish and reappear at will.

- **Lab3:** _"8-PSK Mod-Demod and find the BER over AWGN channel. MATLAB"_
  - *Description:* Explore the realm of 8-Phase Shift Keying (8-PSK) and unravel the mysteries of Bit Error Rate (BER) over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.
  - *Highlights:* Calculate the BER while navigating through the snowy landscape of AWGN, where bits frolic and stumble in the noise.
